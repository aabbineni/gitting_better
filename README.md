## Gitting Better

We use git everyday, but sometimes forget that there's more than just push & pull

###Git Core
* **Commit:** code changes + parents + who dunnit + why
* **ref:** just a reference
* **HEAD:** ref to current commit
* **branch:**  named reference to some commit
* **tag:**  named reference to some commit
* **remote:** repository where you'll look for commits 

###Getting started
* Fork this repo!

###Credit where it's due
These exercises come from a lecture that [Kyle Hargraves](https://github.com/pd) gave at [Enova](https://www.enova.com/) 4/15/15. You can find the slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1atduyqxDJNBv6U9QwIEGdsYMvRUmw54HSFXk0lfYfHc) if you're an Enova employee.
